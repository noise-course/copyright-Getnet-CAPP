## 1 Platform Copyright Policy — TikTok

### A. Detection Methods
- Automated audio fingerprinting: TikTok scans uploaded videos and matches audio against a copyrighted music database.
- Visual/clip detection: TikTok can detect popular movie/TV scenes based on known fingerprints (less strict than YouTube).
- Manual/DMCA reports: Copyright owners can file takedown requests through TikTok’s DMCA system.
- Commercial Music Library rules: Business/creator accounts can only use cleared music; personal accounts have more flexibility.

### B. What Happens When Flagged
- Soft actions: Audio muted, “Sound removed due to copyright,” or video blocked in certain regions.
- Hard actions: Full video removal or temporary restrictions on posting.
- Timing: Some detections happen instantly (audio). Others appear minutes or hours later.

### C. Appeals / Counter-Notice
- In-app appeal: Users can tap “Submit an appeal” or “I have rights to use this audio.”
- DMCA counter-notice: Required only for official DMCA takedowns (not needed for this assignment).

### D. Monetization Rules
- Personal vs Creator/Business: Creator/business accounts cannot use most copyrighted music; only Commercial Music Library tracks.
- Monetization impact: Copyrighted audio usually disables monetization options.
- Commercial Music Library: Contains music cleared specifically for business/creator monetized videos.

### E. Expected Outcomes (Before Experiments)
- Raw clip expected result: Likely to be muted or flagged quickly for copyrighted audio.
- Commentary expected result: May stay up, but audio can still get muted or flagged.
- AI content expected result: Usually allowed; TikTok frequently adds an **“AI-generated”** label; rarely flagged for copyright.

## 2 Experiment 1: Raw Copyrighted Clip (No Transformation)

**Description:**  
I uploaded a 10-second recording of a copyrighted song. The audio was played from my laptop speakers and recorded directly with my phone. I did not add commentary, edits, text, or filters — this was a completely non-transformative upload.

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **exp1-posted.png** – Video visible on my TikTok profile  
- **exp1-notifications.png** – Notifications tab showing no copyright alerts  

**Detection Timing:**  
- Immediately after posting: Video was public and the audio was fully audible  
- After a few minutes: No warnings or copyright flags  
- Notifications panel: No system notices related to copyright  

**Outcome:**  
- The video remained public  
- The audio was not muted  
- No copyright warning, mute notice, or regional block occurred  
- TikTok fully allowed the raw copyrighted clip on this personal test account

**Notes:**  
- This upload is almost certainly **not fair use** under copyright law.  
- TikTok still allowed it, likely due to lenient detection on short clips for personal accounts.  
- This creates a useful contrast for the gap analysis.

## 3 Experiment 2: Commentary / Criticism (Transformative Use)

**Description:**  
I recorded a short commentary clip while copyrighted audio played faintly in the background.  
I explained that I was analyzing the song for an educational assignment, making this a commentary/criticism use.

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **exp2-posted.png**  
- **exp2-final.png**  
- **exp2-notifications.png**

**Detection Timing:**  
- Immediately after posting: Successful upload  
- Notifications: No copyright warnings  
- Video status: Audio remained active  

**Outcome:**  
- The video stayed public  
- Audio was not muted  
- No copyright warnings appeared  
- TikTok treated this the same as Experiment 1

**Notes:**  
- Commentary is one of the strongest fair use categories.  
- Even though legally distinct from Experiment 1, TikTok made no enforcement distinction.

## 4 AI Experiment 1 — Direct Reference (Interstellar-Style Moon Image)

**AI tool & prompt:**  
- Tool: DALL·E (ChatGPT Plus)  
- Prompt: “Create an image of an astronaut standing on the Moon in the style of a modern sci-fi film (Interstellar-style), with Earth rising on the horizon.”

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **ai1-posted.png** – Post visible  
- **ai1-final.png** – Shows the **AI-generated label**  
- **ai1-notifications.png** – No copyright alerts

**Platform Response:**  
- TikTok applied an **“AI-generated”** label automatically  
- No copyright notifications  
- No restrictions  
- TikTok allowed the content, even though it mimics a copyrighted film style

**Notes:**  
- Style mimicry is not directly protected by copyright.  
- TikTok does enforce AI transparency through labeling but **not** through copyright enforcement.

## 5 AI Experiment 2 — Style Mimicry (Studio Ghibli–Inspired Moon Illustration)

**AI tool & prompt:**  
- Tool: DALL·E (ChatGPT Plus)  
- Prompt: “Create an image in the style of Studio Ghibli showing an astronaut exploring the Moon at sunrise.”

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **ai2-posted.png**  
- **ai2-final.png** – Shows the **AI-generated label**  
- **ai2-notifications.png** – No copyright alerts

**Platform Response:**  
- TikTok applied an **“AI-generated”** label automatically  
- No copyright warnings  
- No restrictions  
- Style mimicry of a copyrighted animation style did not trigger enforcement

**Notes:**  
- This demonstrates TikTok’s focus on **AI transparency labeling**, not copyright detection.

## 6 Legal Analysis

### A. Fair Use Analysis for Experiment 1 (Raw Clip)
1. **Purpose & character:** Non-transformative → against fair use  
2. **Nature:** Creative song → against  
3. **Amount:** Clip taken directly from heart of work → against  
4. **Market effect:** Could substitute licensed use → against  

**Conclusion:** Not fair use. TikTok still allowed it.

---

### B. Fair Use Analysis for Experiment 2 (Commentary)
1. **Purpose & character:** Transformative commentary → for fair use  
2. **Nature:** Creative work → slightly against  
3. **Amount:** Reasonable for commentary → for  
4. **Market effect:** No substitution → for  

**Conclusion:** Likely fair use. TikTok still treated it the same as non-fair-use content.

### C. Copyright Analysis of AI Experiments

#### AI Experiment 1 (Interstellar-style)
- Style is not protected by copyright  
- TikTok added **AI-generated** label  
- No copyright enforcement  
- User owns output under DALL·E’s policy  

#### AI Experiment 2 (Ghibli-style)
- Style mimicry ≠ infringement  
- TikTok added **AI-generated** label  
- No copyright enforcement  

**AI Ownership Note:**  
User owns output rights, but not rights to any actual copyrighted characters or identical scenes.

### D. Gap Analysis — Law vs Platform vs Enforcement

**Legal Theory:**  
- Experiment 1 = not fair use  
- Experiment 2 = likely fair use  
- AI mimicry is a gray zone  

**Platform Policy Claims:**  
- Detect and mute copyrighted audio  
- Block infringing content  
- Label AI content  
- Enforce DMCA takedowns

**Actual Enforcement:**  
TikTok did:  
- **No copyright muting**  
- **No blocking**  
- **No differentiation** between fair use and infringement  
- **Applied AI-generated labels** consistently  
- **No detection** of style mimicry  

**Conclusion:**  
TikTok’s real enforcement is dominated by **automated audio detection** and **AI labeling**, not by copyright law.  
There is a major gap between:
- what copyright law requires,  
- what the platform claims, and  
- what actually happens.

This gap shows that platform copyright enforcement is practical, inconsistent, and often unrelated to legal standards.
