## 1 Platform Copyright Policy — TikTok

### A. Detection Methods
- Automated audio fingerprinting: TikTok scans uploaded videos and matches audio against a copyrighted music database.
- Visual/clip detection: TikTok can detect popular movie/TV scenes based on known fingerprints (less strict than YouTube).
- Manual/DMCA reports: Copyright owners can file takedown requests through TikTok’s DMCA system.
- Commercial Music Library rules: Business/creator accounts can only use cleared music; personal accounts have more flexibility.

### B. What Happens When Flagged
- Soft actions: Audio muted, “Sound removed due to copyright,” or video blocked in certain regions.
- Hard actions: Full video removal or temporary restrictions on posting.
- Timing: Some detections happen instantly (audio). Others appear minutes or hours later.

### C. Appeals / Counter-Notice
- In-app appeal: Users can tap “Submit an appeal” or “I have rights to use this audio.”
- DMCA counter-notice: Required only for official DMCA takedowns (not needed for this assignment).

### D. Monetization Rules
- Personal vs Creator/Business: Creator/business accounts cannot use most copyrighted music; only Commercial Music Library tracks.
- Monetization impact: Copyrighted audio usually disables monetization options.
- Commercial Music Library: Contains music cleared specifically for business/creator monetized videos.

### E. Expected Outcomes (Before Experiments)
- Raw clip expected result: Likely to be muted or flagged quickly for copyrighted audio.
- Commentary expected result: May stay up, but audio can still get muted or flagged.
- AI content expected result: Usually allowed; might be labeled as AI-generated; rarely flagged for copyright.

## Experiment 1: Raw Copyrighted Clip (No Transformation)

**Description:**  
I uploaded a 10-second recording of a copyrighted song. The audio was played from my laptop speakers and recorded directly with my phone. I did not add commentary, edits, text, or filters — this was a completely non-transformative upload.

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **exp1-posted.png** – Video visible on my TikTok profile after uploading  
- **exp1-notifications.png** – Notifications tab showing no copyright alerts  


**Detection Timing:**  
- Immediately after posting: Video was public and the audio was fully audible  
- After a few minutes: No warnings or copyright flags  
- After checking the notifications panel: No system notices related to copyright  
- Overall: No copyright detection occurred during the initial monitoring period

**Outcome:**  
- The video remained public  
- The audio was not muted  
- No copyright warning, mute notice, or regional block occurred  
- TikTok fully allowed the raw copyrighted clip on this personal test account

**Notes:**  
- This upload is almost certainly **not fair use** under copyright law because it uses copyrighted audio without transformation.  
- Despite that, TikTok allowed the clip. This suggests TikTok’s enforcement is more lenient for short audio clips uploaded by personal accounts.  
- This result will be important later in the “gap analysis,” showing a difference between legal rules, platform policy, and real-world enforcement.

## Experiment 2: Commentary / Criticism (Transformative Use)

**Description:**  
For this experiment, I recorded a short commentary clip using copyrighted audio playing in the background.  
I spoke over the clip and explained that I was analyzing the song for an educational assignment.  
This transforms the use into commentary/criticism, which is a classic fair use category.

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **exp2-posted.png** – Video visible on my profile after uploading  
- **exp2-final.png** – Video detail page showing whether audio was muted or allowed  
- **exp2-notifications.png** – Notifications tab (any copyright warnings or none)

**Detection Timing:**  
- Immediately after posting: The video uploaded successfully  
- After reviewing notifications: No copyright warnings appeared (based on the screenshots)  
- After checking the video status: The audio remained active and the video stayed public  
- TikTok did not apply any muting or restrictions during the monitoring period

**Outcome:**  
- The video remained public  
- The audio remained on  
- No copyright notification or muting occurred  
- Despite containing copyrighted audio, TikTok allowed it because the clip contained commentary and was likely treated as “original sound”

**Notes:**  
- Commentary is generally the strongest fair-use category under U.S. copyright law (criticism, educational analysis).  
- Legally, this experiment is *more defensible* than Experiment 1.  
- TikTok’s real-world enforcement still allowed the video without any copyright flags, reinforcing that TikTok’s systems often do not detect or punish short background copyrighted audio, especially when mixed with original speech.  

### AI Experiment 1 — Direct Reference (Film-Style Moon Image)

**AI tool & prompt:**  
- Tool: DALL·E (ChatGPT Plus)  
- Prompt: “Create an image of an astronaut standing on the Moon in the style of a modern sci-fi film (Interstellar-style), with Earth rising on the horizon.”

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- **ai1-posted.png** – Post visible on profile  
- **ai1-final.png** – Post page (no copyright or AI warnings)  
- **ai1-notifications.png** – Notifications tab showing no alerts

**Platform Response:**  
- The content remained public.  
- No copyright notifications.  
- No AI-content warnings.  
- No sound muting or post restrictions.  
- TikTok fully allowed the image, even though it mimics a copyrighted film style.

**Notes:**  
- DALL·E grants the user broad rights to output, but it cannot grant rights to third-party copyrighted styles.  
- Style mimicry (e.g., “Interstellar-style”) is a gray zone in copyright law, but TikTok currently does not enforce against it.  
- This result highlights that style-based similarity does not trigger detection on TikTok.

### AI Experiment 2 — Style Mimicry (Studio Ghibli–Inspired Moon Illustration)

**AI tool & prompt:**  
- Tool: DALL·E (ChatGPT Plus)  
- Prompt: “Create an image in the style of Studio Ghibli showing an astronaut exploring the Moon at sunrise.”

**Screenshots Collected:**  
- ai2-posted.png – Post visible on profile  
- ai2-final.png – Post detail page  
- ai2-notifications.png – Notifications tab (no copyright alerts)

**Platform Response:**  
- TikTok allowed the image with no restrictions.  
- No copyright or AI warnings appeared (based on screenshots).  
- Style mimicry of a copyrighted animation style did not trigger any enforcement.

**Notes:**  
- Style mimicry is not directly protected by copyright, even though Studio Ghibli’s characters and exact images are.  
- TikTok does not appear to detect or enforce against style-based AI content.  


## 4 Legal Analysis

### A. Fair Use Analysis for Experiment 1 (Raw Copyrighted Clip)

**1. Purpose and character of the use:**  
- Purely non-transformative.  
- The clip was an unaltered recording of a copyrighted song.  
- This weighs strongly *against* fair use.

**2. Nature of the copyrighted work:**  
- The song is a creative work, which receives the highest copyright protection.  
- This also weighs against fair use.

**3. Amount and substantiality used:**  
- Although only ~10 seconds were used, it was taken directly from the “heart” of the work (the audio itself).  
- Even a short clip can weigh against fair use.

**4. Effect on the market:**  
- Uploading copyrighted audio without transformation could substitute for licensed use or harm the market for the original.  
- This weighs against fair use.

**Conclusion:**  
Experiment 1 is *not* fair use under U.S. copyright law.  
TikTok still allowed it, showing that platform enforcement does **not** always match legal standards.

### B. Fair Use Analysis for Experiment 2 (Commentary / Criticism Clip)

**1. Purpose and character of the use:**  
- Transformative: commentary and educational analysis were added.  
- This weighs strongly *in favor* of fair use.

**2. Nature of the copyrighted work:**  
- Still a creative song, but commentary about a creative work typically leans toward fair use.  
- Slightly against fair use, but less important here.

**3. Amount and substantiality used:**  
- Only background audio was used while commentary was added.  
- Amount used was reasonable for making the point.  
- This leans toward fair use.

**4. Effect on the market:**  
- Commentary does not replace the original work.  
- No market harm.

**Conclusion:**  
Experiment 2 *is likely fair use* legally.  
However, TikTok treated this upload exactly the same as Experiment 1 — no flags, no mutes — showing that TikTok is not evaluating fair use in a legal sense but simply relying on automated audio matching.

### C. Copyright Analysis of AI Experiments

#### 1. AI Experiment 1 (Interstellar-Style Image)
- The style is inspired by a copyrighted film (*Interstellar*), but "style" alone is **not protected** by copyright.
- TikTok did not detect or restrict the content.
- DALL·E assigns the user broad rights to use generated images, but this does not extend to recreating specific copyrighted characters or frames.
- This experiment demonstrates that platforms do not detect film-style mimicry.

#### 2. AI Experiment 2 (Studio Ghibli–Inspired Image)
- The image mimics Studio Ghibli’s visual style, but again, **visual style is not protected**; only specific characters and artwork are.
- TikTok allowed this upload without any warnings.
- This shows that style mimicry remains a gray area that platforms generally do **not** enforce.

**AI Ownership Note:**  
- Under DALL·E’s policy, the user (you) is granted rights to use and publish the outputs.  
- TikTok currently has no copyright-based restrictions on AI art unless it contains actual copyrighted characters.

### D. Gap Analysis — Law vs Platform Policy vs Actual Enforcement

**1. Legal Theory**  
- Experiment 1 is not fair use and would likely be considered infringement.  
- Experiment 2 is a strong fair use case.  
- AI style mimicry falls in a legal gray area (style not protected).

**2. Platform Policy**  
TikTok claims to:  
- Scan audio for copyrighted material  
- Mute or remove infringing content  
- Label AI-generated content  
- Allow only cleared audio for certain account types

**3. Actual Enforcement Observed**  
Across all four experiments, TikTok did *none* of the following:  
- Did not mute copyrighted audio  
- Did not block or restrict any videos  
- Did not apply copyright warnings  
- Did not apply AI labels  
- Did not differentiate between raw infringement and fair use  
- Did not detect style mimicry at all

**Conclusion of Gap Analysis:**  
There is a **significant mismatch** between copyright law, what TikTok claims to enforce, and what actually happens in real-world uploads.  
TikTok’s enforcement is inconsistent, heavily automated, and primarily focused on music licensing—not fair use or legal compliance.  
This demonstrates that platform moderation systems often fail to reflect legal standards and instead rely on pragmatic or commercial priorities.
